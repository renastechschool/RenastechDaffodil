    // What is Page Object Model ?

    /*   Page Object Model is a Design Pattern which has become popular in Selenium Test Automation.
    It is widely used design pattern in Selenium for enhancing test maintenance and reducing code
    duplication.
          Page object model (POM) can be used in any kind of framework such as modular,
    data-driven, keyword driven, hybrid framework etc.
          A page object is an object-oriented class that serves as an interface to a page of your Application Under Test(AUT).
    The tests then use the methods of this page object class whenever they need to interact with the
    User Interface (UI) of that page. The benefit is that if the UI changes for the page,the tests themselves don't need
    to change, only the code within the page object needs to change. Subsequently, all changes to support that new UI is located in one place.
